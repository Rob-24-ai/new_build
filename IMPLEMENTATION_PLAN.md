# ArtSensei Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
An application integrating ElevenLabs conversational AI agent with a custom image analysis backend API, allowing the agent to discuss images provided by users via file upload or camera capture.

## Guiding Principles
- **Minimalist Implementation**: Only implement the absolute minimum to meet requirements
- **Testability Focus**: Pause at the earliest point where testing is possible
- **Iterative Development**: Never proceed past a testable checkpoint without verification

## Focus Management Strategies

To avoid rabbit holes and ensure we stay strictly on track:

1. **Checkpoint-Driven Development**
   - Each implementation task will have a clear, specific "done" criteria
   - Stop and test immediately when a testable component is complete
   - No proceeding to the next step until current functionality is verified

2. **Scope Control Measures**
   - Before implementing any feature, explicitly state what's in and out of scope
   - Document but defer any "nice-to-have" features
   - Each implementation step must tie directly to a requirement in our plan

3. **Time-Boxing**
   - Set time limits for each implementation phase
   - Pause to reassess and simplify if a component takes too long
   - Prefer working functionality over perfect implementation

4. **Regular Progress Reviews**
   - Start each session by reviewing completed work against the plan
   - Measure progress against minimalist requirements only
   - Continuously ask: "Is this the simplest possible implementation that meets requirements?"

5. **Simplification Checkpoints**
   - Periodically ask: "Can we make this simpler while still meeting requirements?"
   - Remove any code that doesn't directly contribute to core functionality
   - Challenge any implementation that seems overly complex

## Current State Assessment

### Backend API
- **Status**: Partially implemented
- **Components**:
  - FastAPI framework with basic endpoints
  - Google Gemini 1.5 Flash integration
  - Image URL processing functionality
  - Environment variable management
- **Strengths**:
  - Well-structured API with proper route definitions
  - Good error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Environment variable management using dotenv
  - Modern AI integration with Google's Gemini model
- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - Missing docstrings on some functions
  - No test infrastructure
  - Limited input validation beyond URL format
  - Hard-coded analysis prompt

### Frontend
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Required Features**:
  - File upload functionality
  - Camera capture capability
  - Voice interaction using ElevenLabs
  
### ElevenLabs Agent
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Required Features**:
  - Agent configuration
  - Tool integration with backend API

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend API Testing and Enhancement
1. **Test existing API functionality**
   - Verify image URL processing works
   - Test Gemini integration with API key
   - Document any issues found
2. **Implement basic test infrastructure**
   - Unit tests for API endpoints
   - Integration test for Gemini service
3. **Enhance error handling and logging**
   - Improve input validation
   - Add structured logging

### Phase 2: ElevenLabs Agent Configuration
1. **Create minimal agent configuration**
   - Basic personality settings
   - Simple response templates
2. **Configure tool integration**
   - Define tool for image analysis
   - Set up proper API connection
3. **Test agent functionality**
   - Verify tool invocation works
   - Test response handling

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation (Minimalist First)
1. **Basic file upload interface**
   - Simple HTML/JS for file selection
   - Image preview functionality
   - API integration for analysis
2. **ElevenLabs voice integration**
   - Add voice controls
   - Connect to agent
3. **Camera capture functionality**
   - Implement device camera access
   - Add capture controls
   - Test image submission flow

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing
1. **Create test scenarios**
   - File upload to analysis
   - Camera capture to analysis
   - Voice interaction flow
2. **Document user flows**
   - Create simple user guide
   - Document API endpoints

## Testing Checkpoints

1. **Backend API Checkpoint**
   - Can the API successfully process an image URL?
   - Does the Gemini integration return valid analysis?
   - Are errors handled appropriately?

2. **ElevenLabs Agent Checkpoint**
   - Can the agent be properly configured?
   - Does tool integration work correctly?
   - Are responses handled properly?

3. **Frontend File Upload Checkpoint**
   - Can users select image files?
   - Is the preview displayed correctly?
   - Does submission to API work?

4. **Voice Integration Checkpoint**
   - Do voice controls function correctly?
   - Is the agent response received and played?

5. **Camera Capture Checkpoint**
   - Can the application access the device camera?
   - Does capture functionality work?
   - Are captured images submitted correctly?

## Next Steps

1. Test existing backend API functionality
2. Implement simple test cases
3. Proceed to ElevenLabs agent configuration after successful backend testing
